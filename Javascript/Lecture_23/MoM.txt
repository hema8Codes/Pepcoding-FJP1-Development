Dev Philosophy
-> Two types of learning
    -> Structured (We learn and then try to do something with what we know). 3 types of classes
        -> Facts class = We will focus on learning the least bit that is requied to eventually build stuff. The focus is on facts but not complete coverage.
        -> Activity class = The aim is to simulate working in a job. The focus is more on getting things done rather than knowing stuff for interviews. It will increase your project creation ability but will not prepare you for interviews because not every aspect will be covered.
        -> Interview class = The focus is on what will be asked in interviews. Theory coverage. Corner cases coverage.
    -> Unstructured (We have to do a job, what is required to learn will be learnt)
        -> Freelancing opportunity via a hackathon
        -> A lecture for pre-requisites (alongwith necessary resources required to do the project)
        -> Hackathon without doubt support (Student has to find things and do things, no spoon-feeding)
        -> Winner takes home
            -> Money, 
            -> Internship opportunity, 
            -> Learning, 
            -> Project, 
            -> Project ideas of other competitors
            -> A stronger profile because you have to submit video with hackathon
        -> All contestants take 
            -> Learning, 
            -> Project, 
            -> Project ideas of other competitors
            -> A stronger profile because you have to submit video with hackathon
