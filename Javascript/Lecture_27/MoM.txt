
Don't concern yourself with understanding every word as of now. Concern yourself with getting familiar with new words.
In facts class and In activity class => Understanding is equal getting familiar with new words.
In interview class we will pick words we have recently became familiar with and meditate around them, understand them deeply.

Facts class (Introduction to new words via small demos) -> 
    -> Activity class (Practice is going to make you experienced wth using recently discovered still-new words and you are going to get a project) -> 
        -> Interview class (Understanding recently discovered words so that we can answer question around our projects) 
        We have a project and we can answer satisfactorily to questions around the project.
